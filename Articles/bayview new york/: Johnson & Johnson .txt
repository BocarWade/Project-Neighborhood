Johnson & Johnson Inc. on Wednesday acknowledged a batch of its COVID-19 vaccine produced by one of its manufacturing partners “did not meet quality standards,” and said it will provide more experts to oversee production.

Earlier, the New York Times reported that 15 million doses of the one-shot vaccine were ruined at a Baltimore production plant run by Emergent BioSolutions EBS, -13.40% , after workers made a mistake with the vaccine’s ingredients. The Times reported the incident prevented federal regulators from approving the plant’s production lines.
