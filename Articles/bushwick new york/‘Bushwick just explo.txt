Saturday Night Live paid tribute to second gentleman Doug Emhoff’s 21-year-old daughter Ella Emhoff, who won over fashion fans with her Batsheva Hay-designed burgundy Inauguration Day dress on 20 January.

Played by SNL featured player Chloe Fineman, who walked into a Passover seder-themed sketch to runway music, Fineman-as-Emhoff said, “Shalom to the children” to her dad (played by Martin Short) and stepmother Kamala Harris (played by SNL host Maya Rudolph).

Voguing to the runway music, Fineman-as-Emhoff said she might look “insane” to some, but, rest assured, she’s “the most normal looking girl in Bushwick. Mamala’s serving matzo while I’m serving looks.”

Emhoff, since her moment at the Inauguration, has gone from a student to a serious budding designer to watch. Emhoff is set to launch a new line with Hay, who is known for her unique dresses with voluminous sleeves.

After much positive attention following Inauguration Day, Emhoff was also signed by IMG Models, featured in New York Fashion Week as a runway model for Proenza Schouler, and appeared on the cover of biannual fashion magazine Dust, now she’s teaming up with Hay to create a knitwear line.

Fans were also enjoying the shout out, with one writing on Twitter, “They referenced Ella Emhoff on SNL and Bushwick just exploded.”

“Ironically, Chloe’s Ella Emhoff is probably the closest we’ll get to Stan Twitter being portrayed on SNL,” wrote another viewer.
