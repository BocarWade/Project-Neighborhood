A mask-less Uber passenger who was caught on video ripping off her driver's mask and coughing on him says she doesn't even have COVID-19 and has threatened to sue the ride-sharing company because he kicked her out of his car.

The unnamed woman was with two others, who were both wearing masks, when Uber driver Subhakar Khadka picked them up on Saturday in San Francisco's Bayview District.

A now-viral video shows the women in the back seat berating Khadka after he asked the mask-less woman to cover her face. She then coughed on him, tried to grab his cellphone and ripped off his face mask.

The woman, dressed only in her underwear, has since posted a video on Instagram in which she refused to apologize over the ordeal.

She claims the driver forced her to get out of his car on a freeway and refused to wait for another Uber to arrive, which she argued was unsafe because it was 'in the hood'.

The woman suggested the driver was 'lucky as hell' she didn't beat him up.

'He lucky as hell I ain't have nothing on me... Cause if we would've played with me, bruh, it would've been a whole different story,' she said.

'75 percent of people I know would have smacked the s**t out of him.

'All I did take his mask off and cough a little bit but I don't even have corona.'

The woman stopped short of apologizing, saying instead: 'I ain't gonna lie, that was disrespectful as f**k. I was dead a** wrong for that'.

She insisted the whole ordeal could have been avoided if the driver had just waited and made sure she and her friends were safe.

The woman, who has threatened to sue Uber, said in the Instagram video that she preferred rival Lyft anyway.

'F**king stupid a** Uber bruh, that's why I take Lyft,' she said.

+7 Subhakar Khadka, 32, says he was racially abused and attacked after picking the three women up in the Bayview area of San Francisco on Sunday

Both Uber and Lyft have since banned the woman from using their ride-sharing services.

In response to the woman's Instagram Live video, Lyft tweeted: 'Although this incident did not involve the Lyft platform, the unacceptable treatment of the driver in this video compelled us to permanently remove the rider from the Lyft community.'

Khadka, the driver, told ABC's Good Morning America on Thursday that the ordeal was 'unbearable' and he believes it was racially motivated.

'She started taunting me, cursing me... they were making fun of my race,' Khadka said.

'It was unbearable. It was threatening, I was scared for my life.'

After the women got out of his car, Khadka said one of the sprayed pepper spray at him through the window.

San Francisco Police are still investigating the incident.

In the now-viral video, the three women can be seen sitting in the back seat of Khadka's car.

One of the women then coughed in Khadka's direction and the three friends could be heard saying: 'F*** the masks.'

As the women continued to shout at Khadka, the mask-less woman then tried to grab his cellphone before ripping off his face mask.

Khadka told CBS: 'I never said anything bad to them, I never cursed, I was not raised that way. I don't hit people, I am not raised that way, so they were not getting out of my car.'

He said the altercation began when he asked the woman to put on her face mask.

When she refused, he said he pulled into a gas station so she could buy one. That's when he says the insults and racial slurs began.

Khadka - who moved to the US from Nepal eight years ago to support his family - added: 'You guys are animals to treat other human beings like this.

'She pepper sprayed inside my car, from the passenger window that was open little bit, that was the only window open in my car.

'If I was another complexion, I would have not gotten that treatment from them. The moment I opened my mouth to speak, they realized I'm among one of them, so it's easy for them to intimidate me.'

He told the women: 'Since you were born and raised here in the United States, don't think the other person is less human.'

Uber said in a statement: 'The behavior seen in the video is appalling. The rider no longer has access to Uber.'

They have given Khadka $120 in cleaning funds.
