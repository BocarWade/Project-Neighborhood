Misbehaviour has consequences and once your ill-mannered shenanigans go viral on social media like everything else in the world, there's almost nothing you can do that will keep you out of trouble.

The whole world saw the video where a passenger assaulted and harassed an Uber driver just because he asked her to wear her face mask. The driver, Subhakar Khadka had the misfortune of getting a cab booking from someone who refused to wear her face mask.

She, along with her other two friends, harassed the driver, coughed on him, called him names, abused him, attacked him with racist comments and even pepper sprayed him.
